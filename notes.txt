# To Do

## About
- I think we should change about to some kind of portfolio? Maybe the CV can be literally my CV and then I can have a portfolio with nice pictures.
- The portfolio could outline my DEVELOP work, show my AGU 2018 poster, and maybe link to some fluid pages

## CV
- Add link below to CV, and other DEVELOP project
- Add links to publications
- Add pdf download option
